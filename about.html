        After graduating my bachelor’s degree and working as an architect in Poland my interests shifted towards computation as a biased, political design tool and 
        the investigation of communication technologies which nowadays have become a critical part of the city infrastructure. I obtained a master’s degree 
        in architecture from KU Leuven in Gent in Belgium where I questioned dependencies between citizens and ubiquitous presence of digital environments, their 
        representations, and related spatial interventions. In my work, I reflect on the impact of media ecology on public space and reconstruct activities such 
        as protest which reveals relationships between media ecology, collective creation, and architecture. To continue this approach, I have started an 
        interdisciplinary PhD research in the Faculty of Architecture and the Faculty of Engineering Technology at KU Leuven in Gent. Now, I focus on the expansion 
        of strategies and devices that could become a critical design tool for investigation of public spaces. Their development plays an active role in the collective 
        creation of urban spaces. </p>
