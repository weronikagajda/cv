    <p class="centertext"><em>architect and interdisciplinary PhD researcher at KULeuven</em></p>
    <p>
        After graduating my bachelorâ€™s degree and working as an architect in Poland my interests shifted towards means of computation as a biased, political design tool   
        and the investigation of communication technologies which, nowadays, have become a critical part of the city infrastructure. In 2021, I obtained my Master's degree   
        at the Faculty of Architecture, KuLeuven. With my thesis, I explored the role of media ecologies in public space/sphere in Warsaw during protests in   
        Poland in 2020/21. Since march 2022, I have been conducting interdisciplinary PhD research in the Faculty of Architecture and the Faculty of Engineering Technology,   
        KULeuven in Gent. In my work, I continue mapping public space through 3D modelling, photogrammetry, scraping, and people's engagement in co-creating collective   
        experiences. I investigates the impact of internet infrastructure on architecture and public life on different scales, from individual use of smartphone devices   
        to digitized representations of cities. Now, I focus on the expansion of strategies and devices that could become a critical design tool for investigation of   
        public spaces. Their development plays an active role in the collective creation of urban spaces. </p>
