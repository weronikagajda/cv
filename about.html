    <p class="biotext">
        After working in architecture firm in Poland my interests shifted towards digital technology as a biased tool creating our environment
        and increasing part of the surrounding. I obtained a master degree in architecture from KULeuven in Gent in Belgium. During my studies
        I started questioning dependencies between ubiquitous presence of digital environments, their representations and interaction with architecture and space.
        Reflecting on the impact of media ecology on space and reconstructing public sphere from the protest in Poland with data
        collected from participants resulted in the project called Citography. It revealed relationships of public space and sphere trough social media
        platforms. To continue this work I started an interdisciplinary PhD research in Architecture and Technology at KULeuven in Gent. Now, I focus
        on development of digital tools that could become a part of inclusive public spaces and play and an active part of collectively created
        urban structure. If you have any questions or suggestions to my work feel free to contact me: weronika.gajda@kuleuven.be </p>
